# eshop
In this project(Maven webapp archetype project) i've implemented internet shop functionality:

1. Cart(client side stored, server side actions)
2. Purchase(will be checked and added to db)
3. Register, Login and Logout modules.
4. Admin Area to manage products and purchases.

Basically it's my previous project 'minishop' rewrited using frameworks.
Technology stack:
1. Spring 4(Spring MVC)
2. Hibernate 5
3. Junit, Mockito
4. Log4j
